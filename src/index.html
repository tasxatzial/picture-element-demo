        <h1>The Silent Sentinel: A Wooden Lighthouse in the Fog</h1>
        <main>
            <div class="description">
                <p>As you walk along the rocky shoreline, a wooden lighthouse emerges from the thick fog, surrounded by leafy trees. The lighthouse's natural wood grain is visible beneath a layer of varnish, adding to its rustic charm. Despite its lack of traditional white and red stripes, the lighthouse's subtle geometric patterns etched into the wood create a unique and understated design.</p>
                <p>But as you approach, you notice that the light is off. The lighthouse stands in silence, no longer guiding lost ships through the turbulent waters. Instead, it's a reminder of the dangers that lie ahead, and the importance of being prepared for the unexpected.</p>
                <p>The misty surroundings and quietness of the lighthouse give the scene a haunting quality, as though the lighthouse is watching and waiting for something to happen.</p>
